                  <h4>Death Proof</h4>
                  <p>
                    Quentin Tarantino's most violent film had a poster that looked like something out of a comic 
                    book. It also looked like the cover of a 1960s paperback thriller novel. The main problem with 
                    the poster is that the car is moving away from the women rather than towards them, which contradicts 
                    the plot.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the horror movie, a psychotic stuntman known as Mike (Kurt Russel) makes it his mission to 
                    deliberately cause accidents and kill people since he is aware that his stunt car is fitted with 
                    various safety features to prevent him from getting injured. He constantly rams into groups of women 
                    in cars, causing them to die on the spot.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Django Unchained</h4>
                  <p>
                    This revisionist western is one of Tarantino's best films. The director brought back a good number of 
                    his frequent collaborators including Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson. Much 
                    praise was given to Waltz for his performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The poster places Jamie Foxx's character Django Freeman right at the front with Dr. King Schultz 
                    (Christoph Waltz) and "Monsieur" Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) behind him. Everyone looks badass. 
                    What makes the poster even more fascinating is the splashing blood behind Django.
                  </p>

                <div class="gallery__item__comment">
                  <h4>Inglorious Basterds</h4>
                  <p>
                    The first thing that strikes you about the poster is the Nazi sign on the very first letter 'O' on the 
                    title. The words just below the title are quite intriguing as well. An inglorious, uproarious thrill-ride 
                    of vengeance? Hell yeah!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Characters are arranged well on the poster too. At the very top, covered in the red shade is the villain: 
                    Standartenführer Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). Below him, on the very front is the chief protagonist Lt. 
                    Aldo "The Apache" Raine (Brad Pitt). The different weapons held by the soldiers also let you know that this 
                    is not your ordinary "shoot em up" war movie. Plenty of work was put into everything associated with this film. 
                    Its huge success was thus not surprising.

                  <h4>Jackie Brown</h4>
                  <p>
                    For Jackie Brown's poster, there isn't just room for improvement, there is a hall for improvement. The movie is 
                    the least popular project in Tarantino's filmography. It almost feels like not much effort was put into the 
                    project as a whole and even the poster shows this. Jackie Brown was also the least awarded of Tarantino's films, 
                    with only one Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and less than 20 nominations overall across different 
                    award organizations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Jackie Brown, Tarantino brought back his favorite muse Samuel L. Jackson and also managed to cast Pam Grier in 
                    her first leading role. The supporting cast was also full of big names such as Robert De Niro and Michael Keaton. 
                    With such big names, a lot more could have been done with the poster.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Kill Bill: Volume One</h4>
                  <p>
                    See? Very similar to Kill Bill: Volume 2. However, what made the poster for the first film better was the inclusion 
                    of additional characters in it. Signatures of Tarantino, as well as those of a couple of the cast members, also 
                    appear in select versions of the poster.

                <div class="gallery__item__comment">
                  <h4>Kill Bill: Volume 2</h4>
                  <p>
                    Kill Bill: Volume 2's poster is almost identical to Kill Bill: Volume 1's poster. Uma Thurman poses in an 
                    identical manner in both posters. It's a pose more fitting to movies about medieval warriors like Conan 
                    The Barbarian. The only difference between the two posters is that Uma Thurman is wearing yellow in the first one.

                  <h4>Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood</h4>
                  <p>
                    Tarantino's latest film was well-received by critics and award organizations. At the Oscars, it was nominated for 
                    10 awards. However, fans were quite divided about it. Many felt that the movie was too slow-paced and only became 
                    interesting in the final hour. As for the poster, it was the most simple of all Tarantino posters. No effort was made 
                    to incorporate any artistic elements into it. Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt simply posed for a photo in front of the 
                    1966 Cadillac Coupe DeVille that Pitt's character drives a lot in the movie, and that was it.

                  <h4>Pulp Fiction</h4>
                  <p>
                    Is there a better 90s poster than this? Even though the poster leaves out other interesting characters in the movie like 
                    Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), putting Uma Thurman serves the purpose of letting 
                    potential viewers know that they are going to be created to a great gangster flick.

                <div class="gallery__item__comment">
                  <h4>Reservoir Dogs</h4>
                  <p>
                    The white, red, and black color schemes tell the viewer what to expect in the movie. All the characters wear black suits 
                    with white shirts in the movie. Are they the real "Men In Black?" More like the "Bleeding Men In Black." For most of the 
                    final hour, the shirts of the characters are soaked in blood.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The color plastered all over the title in the poster signify the blood in the movie. We wonder how much of the modest $1.5 
                    million budget went into buying ketchup. What's even more impressive was that Tarantino only used only $1.5 million to make 
                    a movie. The money was raised from investors, some of whom had weird demands.

                  <h4>The Hateful Eight</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Hateful Eight was another Tarantino film that didn't get a lot of love. Problems started quite early, with the original 
                    script leaking to the public hence forcing good Ol' Quentin to write a new one. And, before it's theatrical release, the movie 
                    was leaked by pirate group Hive-CM8.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The group went on to apologize for the leak. The rain continued to pour on Quentin. He didn't get a Best Director nomination 
                    at the Oscars as usual. On Rotten Tomatoes, the movie only had a score of 75% which made it the second-lowest rated movie in 
                    his catalog. As for the poster, well... not bad.
